    <div class="desc">5G has stimulated the economy in many different ways, from creating jobs to allowing people in rural areas to connect to the world. Some studies have shown 5g may have harmful effects on DNA and can cause cancer, but so far experts have rebuked these ideas.</div>

    <div class="desc">This is the gif I made for my 5G project. It shows the 5G tower ruining the beautiful natural landscape. It also shoes the radio waves sending signals out. I worked really hard on this and really enjoy making these gifs.</div>

    <div class="desc">This was project in which we learned how to isolate colors from an image. I chose La La Land because it is such an iconic cover and one of my favorite movies. This project helped me learn how to look at the finer pixels and how so many small pixels or color form a bigger image.</div>

    <div class="desc">For this unit we worked with the MIT app inventor. I made my own online food ordering business. With Laurel's Fine Dining Establishment, patrons can add items to their basket, confirm payment, and checkout. The currency used at my restuarant is Zimbabwean dollars, which is done to make patrons be more consious about the needless money they spend on gourmet food. In this capitalistic world, we hold "Michelin" star restuarants and "gourmet" food to higher standards, and we are willing to pay more just because "Gordon Ramsey" made it. This project is to prove that people will buy anything if it looks expensive, even if it is bang energy. This project gave me more expirence with formatting and how coding is used to make my everyday apps.</div>

  <p>This example use media queries to re-arrange the images on different screen sizes: for screens larger than 700px wide, it will show four images side by side, for screens smaller than 700px, it will show two images side by side. For screens smaller than 500px, the images will stack vertically (100%).</p>
