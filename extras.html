	<p>Here I am with the rest of my boat as we take home gold and silver from the 2023 Southwest Rowing Regional Championships!! I worked so hard with these girls all year, almost every day after school. This year we got second in our 8-person boat and first in our 4-person boat. Now we are on our way to Nationals in Sarasota, Florida!! I can't wait to see where rowing takes me in the future</p>

           <p>Every year with my jazz band we get the amazing oppurtinity to play at Yoshi's jazz club. This is a fun sushi restaurant in downtown Oakland. I have played trombone here 2 times, each being funner then the last. It's a super great way to show my skills and play with my friends.</p>
